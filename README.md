## Usage 

Change directory to the artifacts folder: 

`cd spc19-test-network` (default folder location) 
 
**To start services and the network:**

`./run.sh` starts all the docker containers

**To stop services :**

`./stop.sh` stops the entire network, and you can resume where it left off with `./resume.sh` 

`./remove.sh ` will first stop and then remove all containers and images
